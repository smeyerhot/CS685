Keep the AC to a minimum or use ceiling fan instead. Drink plenty of water and warm fluids. Avoid eating out, partying. Avoid unnecessary travel.You need not quarantine yourself in the strictest manner but some amount of restrictions in interacting and meeting with the community is advised.Lastly, where are you currently? Your place of residence and country? Is it a Corona endemic country? Did you talk to or interact with any known or suspected flu patient?Can you please take a picture of the back of the throat with open mouth showing details of the tonsils and pharyngeal wall and send it to me?

Two days later, I consulted with a doctor. He prescribed Cavidur 625, Montek LC, Ambrolite syrup and Betaline gargle solution. Since then throat infection improved and frequent cough also coming out. Coughing also improved remarkably though not completely. From yesterday onwards fever is occuring (maximum 100-degree Celcius).
