Do you have a temperature?Have you traveled internationally or locally?Do you have a fever?It is seeming to be becoming necessary to be more vigilant about COVID-19.I suggest you make an appointment to see a Doctor. What treatment would be best for severe cough while pregnant?Hi, I am 34 weeks pregnant and I was pregnant last November and I just got my check up by my GP last week and I have visible stethoscope on my chest. What would be the best way to get the test done? I am also using Asthalin & Augmentin for a pain reliever. Thank you Hari\n",

I was in teh hospital for 9 days. I am on 20mg of Warfin per day! My blood levels are holding steady at 2.67. Yesterday I had a bit of lower back pain and today it is between my shoulder blades, mostly on my right side. It hurts my back to breathe, swallow, and move. Just sore muscles or could it be something serious with the blood clot? I hate to rush into the doctor if it is nothing....I hope you can help! Thanks  Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Since you are taking warfarin (blood thinner), possibility of pulmonary embolism (PE) related pain is less likely.Possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more likely. So avoid heavyweight lifting and\n"

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Allergic reactions manifest as itching and body rashes. Sometimes in severe forms of allergy you might experience breathlessness and severe respiratory distress. Chest pain and hypertension not related to allergy and it might be something else. Wishing you good health. Thanks.

      " In brief:   Fever with sputum.   It can be bacterial or parasitic. Usually we are not certain about the exact cause of the symptoms, but one has to rule out certain things, like COVID-19. Usually, a person sees the doctor but notices that there are no signs of infection, even if the sputum is deep in the lungs, and that person is coughing. The most common cause is an abscess, which can be caused by a simple sputum examination and then a chest X-ray is required. (3/21/20)  Would you like to video or text chat with me?

He can hear and feel the heart beating fast. When this happens he feels like he is dying. Also when the wheezing stops suddenly and when he coughs up the cough is also normal.I went to the doctor and she gave him an inhaler. He has a cough medicine, with a soothing voice (as it sounds like he is saying) but the only medicine he can find that is suitable for this heavy cold. I am afraid to take it as my husband has a bad cold/upper respiratory tract infection....I have been dealing with this for 2 months now. Hello dear,I understand your concern.In my opinion, you should not worry much.If you are under medical control then you have better options, such as tablet ibuprofen or amoxyllin (bronchoalveolar) for fever/sore throat /shortness of breath..I would suggest you to consult your doctor consultation to assess the situation further.Regards,Dr. Rohit M.

I have been experiencing constant pains on and off since I started smoking. I went through the report that states that my sinuses were infected and spread through my nose. However, since the initial symptoms have been less persistent and I'm finding odd clusters of small bumps all over my face, I suspect it may be Coronavirus infection. Is there anyway to treat this with mask and what else can I do? Hello,The symptoms as mentioned in your post can be attributed to Acute exacerbation of an infection of the sinus.Management involves:1. A course of antibiotics based on culture & sensitivity reports.2. Asthalin+ Seroflo inhaler- provide symptomatic relief by causing broncho-dilation (dilating the smaller airway passages, relieving the obstruction & increasing airflow to lungs). So, it can be used during an acute attack.3. Montelukast preparations- used as a maintenance therapy to relieve symptoms of seasonal allergies & asthma.4. Antihistamines like Cetrizine can also be used to provide symptomatic relief.5. Also make sure that you are well protected from exposure to cold, dust or other allergens.If symptoms still persist, kindly consult an Allergist & get a proper physical evaluation.Wishing a good health.Take care.\n",

      "Hi,If your father is suffering from throat pain then it might be due to upper respiratory infection or acute bronchitis then he would require antibiotics (quinolones or macrolides or cephalosporins or amoxicillin with clavulanic acid) with antihisamines,nebulization and steam inhalation.Now.asthma is itself a allergic disease due to cold or dust or pollens or grass etc irrespective of the triggering factor.You can go for pulmonary function tests if not done.Treatment is mainly symptomatic which might require steroids inhalers,beta receptor agonists,anticholinergics (as MDI or rotahaler) as a regular treatment.To decrease the inflammation of bronchi and bronchioles,you might be given oral antihistamines with mast cell stabilizers(montelukast) and steroids (prednisolone) with nebulization and frequently steam inhalation.The best way to cure any allergy is a complete avoidance of allergen or triggering factor.Consult your pulmonologist for further advise.\n",
