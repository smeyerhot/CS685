As the name suggests that there are certain secretions from the back of your nose that are trickling down into your throat provoking cough especially when you lie down or sit for long time. This is seen commonly individuals with nasal and respiratory allergies like you have described (sneezing and asthma like symptoms).Since the root cause of your cough is nasal secretion that should be the target of treatment. You could try the following:1) Plain steam inhalation twice a day especially after you come back home from outside and also before going to bed. After taking steam for 10-15 mins clear your nose and hawk and cough out the phlegm in your throat. This will help preventing nasal allergies as well as night cough. Steaming can be continued indefinitely as it is a natural remedy.2) Anti histaminics like cetrizine before bedtime will prevent nasal secretions and prevent sleep disturbances.3) you could also try out steroid based nasal sprays containing fluticasone or mometasone. These are very effective in reducing nasal hypersensitivity to whatever induces you allergies, thus reducing sneezing,postnasal drip and cough. However these sprays need to used with caution keeping certain medical conditions in mind. Hence please consult a physician for the same.4) please take precautionwhen going outside like using protective masks to prevent dust inhalation.As for the breathing difficulty you need to see a repiratory physician and do necessary tests to determine whether these asthamatic episodes are allergic or not and whether you require inhalers.Hope this helps. Please take care.\n","\n","\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["input: \n","I have very mild symptoms of covid 19.
