I have asthma and I have cough from past two years. I have seen a lot of patients with bronchitis and have been to the doctor 4 times. Two of them were told they had type 1 diabetes and it turned into type 2 diabetes. Is this true? Hi Brent,Your history suggest that you are having allergic rhinitis, bronchitis and a high immune system.You should see your pulmonologist and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). You will need inhaled cortico quinolones and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and inhaled cortico quinolones (formoterol or fluticasone).Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.\n"

Initially, I thought it was a cold, but now I got cold, and I'm still sore. I can do a lot of things while coughing, and sometimes I have to do some breathing exercises that don't help. Hi, thanks for using healthcare magicItchy upper respiratory tract can lead to upper respiratory tract infection or common cold such as coughing,nasal blockage, bronchitis, laryngitis,  any malaise etc., So do not worry. You can use salbutamol and ibuprofen to cure that.I hope this helps\n"

            "hello,Angina is considered a mild angina but can be triggered by multiple factors like allergies/obstruction etc.Angina could be triggered by skin irritants/feces etc.If your symptoms are mild, you would not need to worry much about it.Asthma is the most common cause of your symptoms.Management involves:1. A course of antibiotics based on culture & sensitivity reports.2. Asthalin & Seroflo inhaler- provide symptomatic relief by causing broncho-dilation (dilating the smaller airway passages, relieving the obstruction & increasing airflow to lungs)So, you can use it whenever you need it.3. Montelukast preparations- used as a maintenance therapy to relieve symptoms of asthma.4. Antihistamine & anti allergic drugs should be taken only if needed.5. Steam inhalation & deep breathing exercises.6. Maintain adequate hydration & a healthy balance diet.7. Also make sure that you are well protected from cold, dust & other allergens.If symptoms still persist, kindly consult your ENT doctor for proper clinical examination.Wishing a good health.Take care.\n",

Want opinionhi sir im a resident physician, we have this clinicopathologic conference case here, i would just like to ask your opinio with our case...hope you can help us with the diagnosis and differentials.... General Data This is a case of a 27 year old female, single, Catholic from Samar, admitted for the first time due to severe throbbing headaches and enlargement of the abdomen. History of Present Illness Condition started 8 months PTA, when she suddenly felt severe throbbing headaches while lying down, occurring alternately between the right and left sides of the head, lasting approximately an hour with associated nausea. The pain would be slightly relieved by Paracetamol. This was also associated with blurring of vision. The patient was noted to have light perception, but other figures were described as “cloudy”. There was also notable enlargement of the abdomen prior to headaches, no change in the frequency of bowel movement (defecates every other day) as claimed by the patient. She denied of any intimate contact. Seven months PTA, the headache and nausea persisted, this time associated with dizziness. Symptoms progressed until 5 months PTA, when the patient consulted a neurologist. She was diagnosed to have an intracranial tumor. Ophthalmologic examination was also sought by the patient. She was also referred to a surgeon and gynaecologist for the evaluation of abdominal enlargement. There were episodes of difficulty in urination, more felt at the latter part of voiding. Four months PTA, consultation was done in another institution. A skull x-ray was taken and was found to be unremarkable. A cranial MRI examination was advised to patient but deferred due to financial constraints. 1 week PTA, the cranial MRI was eventually done and the patient was subsequently advised admission. Ultrasound of the abdomen was also done which revealed a large complex mass in the left ovary.

            "Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. First, regarding allergies, at present you are having respiratory allergies. They are commonly cause by air-borne substances in the environment like house dust mites, indoor molds, cockroach proteins, pet animal dander, pollens in your region, etc.2. Most of the medications that you take for allergies, in your case, Duonase and Seroflo, can only \"control\" the symptoms, they do not \"cure\" the allergies unless you change your environment to reduce exposure to the substances to which you are allergic to.Hence, on stopping medications, your symptoms would return.3. Were I treating you, I would add montelukast and an antacid like pantoprazole to your treatment for at least 4-6 weeks. These will help reducing your requirements of inhalers and vomiting sensation respectively.4. I would also suggest you allergy testing, which will help you to identify the substances you may be allergic to and to know the measures to avoid them.Based on your allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immnotherapy which works on immune system to gradually improve allergy symptoms.5. I would also suggest you regular breathing exercises and a healthy diet rich in vitamins & minerals (adequate amounts of green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc) which will improve your lung capacity and immunity respectively in a long run.6. In general, I would suggest you to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution.7. Feeling tasteless may be a side effect of Azithromycin, mostly it will improve by itself within a few days.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health.Thank you & Regards.\n",

            "Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your son's history. Getting out of breath can be a symptom of both heart and respiratory disease. But if your son already has asthma, breathlessness/wheezing after exercise/sports suggests what we call \"exercise-induced bronchospasm\". Usually it means your son's asthma is not under adequate control and he needs to upgrade his controller asthma medications. Personally I would suggest adding montelukast for asthma control which works better in this type of symptoms.I would also suggest him to take an inhaler like salbutamol or levosalbutamol 20 minutes before starting exercise/playing. Or he can take a tablet montelukast 30 minutes before exercise/play. Also, have a slow warm-up like walking/jogging for 5-10 minutes around half-an-hour before scheduled play will also reduce his symptoms. Hope this will make things clear to you and will be helpful.Wish your son the best of the health.Regards.\n",

Such pain is called referred pain.As you are already onto the antibiotics your infection should come down.

            "Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Yes, you are correct in some cases.In some patients with allergic conditions there is a need for bronchodilators. Nasal decongestant or antiallergic (lofloxacin) will be better and effective.But for a patient like you, bronchodilators have to be under control in some of these conditions. Nasal bronchodilator is not only helpful to treat allergic conditions. In some cases, even the patient may resort to analgesics like bronchodilators, even if it is not working properly.It can take medications prescribed. But it is important to ensure that you are well protected from exposure to the elements.If you develop symptoms, I would suggest you to consult with a respiratory medicine specialist and get done clinical evaluation done.As you are already having symptoms of respiratory symptoms, I would suggest you to get your total count by clinical examination.Hope this helps you.Wish you good health.\n",

These infections usually start with fever, usually moderate to high.However, if he has frequent cough and cold without significant fever, each time lasting usually a week or more, I would suggest allergy. I would suggest daily montelukast and levocetirizine for treatment and prevention of respiratory allergy.Avoidance of dusts-smoke-air pollution-cold air currents will help, so as a nutritive diet rich in vitamins and minerals.

She's 29 years old and only started this condition couple of years ago. Other than using her inhaler is there anything else she can do to overcome the shortness of breath? Thanks.. \n",
            "Hello dear, The symptoms as mentioned in your post can be attributed to Hyper-responsiveness of breath and breathing difficulty. In asthma there is an overlap between episodes of the asthma and cardiovascular problems as a result of narrowing of the respiratory tree of asthma pathology. The frequency of exacerbation is reduced due to acute exacerbation of the respiratory tract due to the exacerbation of respiratory tract infection. The effects of inhaler can also be attributed to acute exacerbation of the asthma and inhaling the airway causing the narrowing of the bronchioles. It is best to consult a pulmonary specialist and get done clinical examination of the respiratory system to rule out any secondary cause like exacerbation of asthma.\n",

Probably this is why you are still in pain in spite of being on such a high dose of opioids. Since such a high dose of opioids can cause respiratory failure, doctors obviously feel uncomfortable in prescribing it. In my opinion, you should try alternative methods of pain relief like nerve blocks, acupuncture etc. Even if these bring only some relief, you will at least be in a better position than now.Best wishes.\n",

            "Hello. Thanks for posting your query at our health forum. It seems your son has developed an upper respiratory tract infection ( mostly viral ) and hence has developed cough, cold and runny nose. It is better to wait for 2 days because antibiotic usage due to chances of developing resistance, is not prescribed right away. You can continue giving him Paracetamol syrup for his fever twice daily after food, and benadryl cough syrup, 10 ml twice daily. The benadryl syrup is only to be used when his coughing is continuous. It will make him slightly drowsy, so it is better he stays home during the treatment. You can try giving him some steam inhalation. It will help him recover from his cold soon. If there is a lot of congestion, then Oxymetazoline ( Nasivion ) Nasal drop can be used, 2-3 drops per nostril, to relieve the congestion. But also take precautions to not to use it regularly and only when he has severe congestion.If he's not recovering in a day or two, and also if his fever is high grade, it is better to start him on antibiotics. I will recommend Syp. Amoxycillin 10 ml once daily ( not more than 250 mg for his age, normally it is 125 mg/5 ml ) for 5-7 days depending upon his severity. But persistent high grade fever will warrant a blood test to rule out malaria/typhoid e.t.c, which can be planned by your local GP. However, don't be alarmed unnecessarily. I feel its VIRAL URTI and it will be relieved on proper usage of medication. If you have vitamin c tablets, you can give him one per day. It is helpful in cold.Hope this is helpful.Feel free to discuss further.Regards\n",

            "Hello,  The swelling in the upper ear can be from various reasons, allergies, infection, or from strep throat infection.  It can be due to swelling of the area leading up to or coming from sinus.  The first thing you should do is to get yourself assessed.  And this is not an allergy.  Usually the best way to treat allergy is to get your blood pressures measured, fever, chest x ray done, and X-ray done.  This can be done after you have done the allergy test.     Would you like to video or text chat with me?\n",

I took peto-bismol for a week and no help a week ago I started Imodium softgetl and only little help...then I read about probiotics and started taking Ultimate FLORA probiotic 80 billion live cultures.. the question is can I take Imodium also the same day? Thanks \n",
            "Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Doxycycline can be taken three to five times in a day. Most probably not more than once in a week, depending on the dosage. The dose may be minimal. If Doxycycline is helpful, no need to worry too much about it. Possibility of pneumonia depends on the patient and the underlying cause of pneumonia. Possibility of pneumonia is more in response to infection rather than the cause itself. This can cause pneumonia as well as respiratory depression. Possibility of pneumonia may be due to poor immune system. So, better to consult a General Physician and get done clinical examination of respiratory system with sputum and culture and sensitivity reports.\n",
            "Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history. I think your daughter has allergic respiratory problem but I would like to ask more questions about nature of cough, cold, whether she wheezes, frequency of symptoms etc to know exact nature of her disorder.However, for allergic respiratory diseases, I would suggest her Montelukast whenever she develops symptoms. This will reduce her symptoms along with other medications prescribed by your pediatrician.If she is is having problems during any specific season, I would suggest to start daily Montelukast 2 weeks before the season and continue during the season. This will also reduce the number of episodes.I would suggest you to avoid exposure to dusts, smoke and air pollution as much as possible. Limiting foods that usually trigger her episodes will also help.Childhood allergic respiratory disorders usually can improve by ages of 6-8 years but it depends on type of allergy she has, her diet and environment, hereditary factors, genetics, etc. So it's difficult to predict most of the times.I would also suggest you to consult an Allergist who will suggest her allergy testing and help you identify what to avoid and how to.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish your daughter the best of the health.Regards.\n",

            "Why do I keep coughing after I have quit smoking?I am 39 years and quit smoking 7 years ago. I never coughed, coughed anything up, etc after quitting.  I have always had chronic sinus issues and been on lots of antibiotics and take mucus relief fairly often.  I get shortness of breath out of nowhere.  I have inhalers, and albuterol for nebulizer, prednisone, etc to help, but it takes a while to get back to breathing normal.  I excercise regularly and occasionally get bad headaches from shortness of breath.  Been to doctors and they just tell me my lungs are clear and give me an antibiotic and/or an inhaler. \n",
            "Hello,Welcome to HCM,As the above information you have provided suggests that you have a sinus problem.As you are having difficulty breathing while exerting yourselves, you should go for routine blood investigation and clinical examination. You should also complete routine blood analysis if you develop respiratory problems like asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, hypertension, hypertension, chronic cough etc.You must go for a complete physical check up and chest X- ray chest with X-ray chest X-ray chest to rule out any pathology, including pathology of lungs or enlarged lung tissue, liver or liver enzymes.You may also undergo routine blood investigation of your lung and lung to rule out any pathology along with your current physical examination if possible.This will identify the underlying pathology of the lung and will advise you accordingly.Wish you the best of the health.\n",

            "HelloThank for asking at HCM.In our clinic, a child with asthma is typically a sign of having broncho-constriction (breathing issue). This presents as fever and wheezing (shortness of breath). It can be due to many reasons,1. Correlation of the respiratory tract with infection in respiratory tract.2. Due to this illness, the child's respiratory tract itself may be compromised by poor immune system, recurrent allergies or urinary tract infection.3. The infection can be managed through allergy testing.4. Antihistamines like Cetrizine can help.5. Depletion is recommended in case of allergic recurrent allergic activity.The most common drugs for asthma attack are inhaled bronchodilators, which are usually not used unless they are very serious.Sometimes asthma, I also use albuterol or amoxyllin but the child can be allergic to any substance.So if he doesn't get relief then the child's asthma should be treated appropriately by his doctor.Hope this helps you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you all the best of the health ahead.Regards.\n",
            "Hi, you should not be this much depressed as this disease can be managed in such a way that your boy can live a prouctive life although you need to take more precaution then others. avoid cold and dust exposure, try to prevent any respiratory tract infection and if this happen then get it managed by a physician as early you can, avoid home dust exposure also.consult a chest specialist for proper use of all the anti allergic drug available and mantain a regular follow up for dose adjustment of these drugs which is needed regularly according to the status of the patient to prevent any side effect of these medicines.few  years of symptom free life can revert back hyperresponsive lung pathology to normal healthy lung, you can also get a list of all allergen to which your boy is hypersensitive by complete pannel allergen test.thanks for consulting HCM, take care.\n",

Could this be bronchitis or pneumonia? \n",
            "Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Bronchitis is caused due to infection in the respiratory tract and is mainly due to inflammation in the respiratory tract and causes bronchitis.It can be due to narrowing of the airway passages and you should be under regular care.Bronchitis is typically caused by irritation of respiratory passages, but a few times it can also be due to some systemic factors such as allergies, irritants, or medications.You can consult pulmonologist for proper clinical examination and treatment.You should consider bronchoscopy, ultrasonography (exercortometer).Stinging of airway passages will help you identify the causative organism by culture.You should consult pulmonologist for proper clinical evaluation and management.So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical treatment.Wishing you good health.\n",
            "hi,    I have gone through your query & do understand your concern. Pregnancy hormones/ increasing size of abdomen & less hemoglobin make adverse conditions for breathing problem.. so asthama tends to increase in pregnancy. But asthma treatments are safe  & so management of asthma in pregnancy becomes easy.   Feeling of weight on chest along with low blood pressure out of exhaustion & breathlessness demands an immediate medical check up & investigations by a chest physician, get your asthma status evaluated & start with treatment advised instantly.  -  A healthy life style/ avoiding asthma triggers/ avoiding allergens/ avoiding physical & psychological stress along with medicines would prove beneficial. - Regular practice of respiratory exercises ( Pranayama) would help improvement.   thanks.\n",

            "Hello dear,I understand your concern. From your symptoms it seems you are having borderline disorder. You need to consult an ENT specialist for complete blood count and therefore to determine the diagnosis. As your treating doctor would recommend a total blood count, which is a very important step.The cause of your diabetes is very much depend on the diabetes patient. You need to exclude all non diabetes patients, whether they have underlying medical conditions, or if they are diagnosed with diabetics, and what is the reason for taking any particular medication. In my opinion you should get done clinical examination of your treating doctor and take complete blood counts. Diabetes is a chronic disease with many complications.Your blood counts might be low, but the risk of cardiac failure is very high. I would advise you to complete blood counts, which are important in such cases. Hope this helps.\n",

Can the pneumonia deplete his lung function over time? What, if anything, can I do to reduce the number of infections? \n",
            "Hello, thanks for using healthcare magicThe pneumonia deplete of lung function is due to acute exacerbation of asthma.Management involves:1. A course of antibiotics based on culture & sensitivity reports.2. Asthalin & Seroflo inhaler- provide symptomatic relief by causing broncho-dilation (dilating the smaller airway passages, relieving the obstruction & increasing airflow to lungs). So, it is better to take symptomatic treatment for pneumonia.3. Montelukast preparations- used as a maintenance therapy to relieve symptoms of broncho-dilation (dilating the smaller airway passages, relieving the obstruction & increasing airflow to lungs)4. Antihistamines like Cetrizine can also be used to provide symptomatic relief.5. Steam inhalation & deep breathing exercises.6. Also make sure that he is well protected from cold, dust & other allergens.If symptoms still persist, kindly consult a Pulmonologist for proper clinical evaluation.Wishing him a good health.Take care.\n",

Worsening of asthma.So you will need a chest x-ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). A chest x-ray is needed to rule out lung infection. PFT is needed to know the severity of asthma. You may need antibiotics, longer acting inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).Don't worry you will be alright with all these.Hope I have answered your query.

I would recommend you to follow up with your doctor. In this case I would think of a case it would be wise to take steroids. The steroids would also be the safest for your health.

But I can assure you that modern medicine is the most scientific method of treatment in which sometime raw materials are also processed from herbs.Query 3: No, you will not require to take alternative medications if you follow physician's advise properly.Query 4: If cold is a trigger of your asthma, then you better think once more before shifting to cold region.For asthma management, we follow step care management according to patient’s disease status.So my suggestion is: Please consult with a respiratory medicine specialist to confirm the diagnosis (by clinical features, physical examinations, objective test etc) and get treated accordingly.Hope this answers your query.

If no improvement was achieved, she should be assessed as a lung specialist or neurologist should be given oral antibiotics.

            "Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.There are many factors contributing to development of respiratory allergy in a child. Heredity, environment (pollution, humidity, temperature, etc),  dietary habits, etc contribute to it.I guess your son has allergic rhinitis with childhood asthma.I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist, who may suggest allergy testing after detailed history from you. Allergy testing will help to know type of asthma (allergic or non-allergic) and if it is allergic, identification of allergen causing the problems to your son. If indicated, he may suggest specific allergen immunotherapy to your son which works on immune system to treat the allergy.Regarding age of cure, it depends on type of asthma. Most childhood asthma improve by 6-7 years of age, but if a child is highly allergic, herediary and environmental factors are there, he may continue to have asthma later.I am surprised to know that your son is only 4 years old and he is able to use rotacaps. Generally older children only can use rotacaps appropriately. If technique of using rotacaps is not correct, the drug does not go into lungs in right amounts. So I would suggest you to show the technique of using rotacaps to any pediatrician/physician and if it is not correct, you may use Metered Dose Inhalers with Spacers for budecort. Personally I believe Inhaler with Spacer is best equipment for a 4 years child.Hope this will help you and solve your queries.Wish your son the best of the health.Regards.\n",

My doctor rang to say there is no change but didn t recommend I do anything different. I have continued my physiotherapy to bring up whatever is in my lungs. The cramping I am now experiencing is excruciatingly painful. I just don t know what to do next. I live in a remote area and accessing a doctor or hospital is difficult. Please help. \n",
            "Hello,Welcome to HCM,Respiratory pain is due to pneumonia.If you have been exposed to pneumonia or pneumonia you should undergo routine blood count, CT scans, X-ray and pulmonologist.Consult pulmonologist for proper clinical evaluation.If the pneumonia is identified and evaluated you should follow proper treatment.If the diagnosis is confirmed you will be assessed for appropriate treatment.The chest pain was due to bronchospasm.The diagnosis itself is based on severity only.So better to consult pulmonologist who will then guide you further management.Thank you.\n",
            "Thank you for the query.I would like to know your age and whether you suffer from any associated comorbidities like Diabetes mellitus, Hypertension or Thyroid dysfunction.As per the history provided, you are suffering from dry cough, bodyache, swollen glands, coryza and occasionally high grade fever (body overheating may imply that), for a period of 2 days. Your symptoms are more in favour of a viral infection. In a sunstroke you will get other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, severe cramps, dry skin, dizziness and severe headache. I would advise you to take bed rest for a few days and drink plenty of water and fluids (avoid alcohol). If your body gets overheated you can go for cold or tepid sponging. A nutritious diet is advisable, and if you are a smoker, you must abstain from smoking (this irritates your respiratory tract and aggravate your cough). If you have nasal congestion and throat irritation, steam inhalation may help. In case of severe bodyache, acetaminophen may be taken (after consulting your physician). Please monitor your urine output.If you develop any of the symptoms mentioned above or your symptoms do not subside in another couple of days, please consult your physician, since you may need a thorough physical check up and a course of antibiotics may be needed.Hope this helps you out.\n",

If there is a PFT, I would advise to complete the complete ENT scan and then an ECG (Transverse Inflammatory System).

            "Having difficulty in taking deep breath. Taking pseudophedrine. Taking synthroid for hypothyroidism. Are these related?I have been having breathing problems for a few years now. I have no wheeze at all, but I have trouble getting a deep breath. I have tried a variety of asthma medicines and none work at all for me. The only medicine that does work for me is pseudoephedrine. I do not want to a make a habit of taking it though, as I find it hard on the nervous system. As an aside, I am treated for hypothyroidism and take 137 mcg of synthroid daily. I was wondering if this breathing issue could result from insufficient thyroid hormones. I have a feeling the effect pseudoephedrine has on my breathing is a result of its effect on my nervous system rather than its effect as a decongestant. Could it be that pseudoephedrine stimulates my thyroid and hence my respiratory rate is increased? It s been a long, hard battle with this and I would appreciate insightful feedback. After dealing with this for years, I am happy to know something works. Now I just need to know why it works so I can get on a safer medication. \n",

            "Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to know more about you like: a. Do you have wheezing/breathing difficulties? b. Do you have any nose problems? c. What is the cause of sleep apnea? d. What is the cause of obesity? e. Do you smoke? f. Any allergies? g. Any other medical conditions/medications use?Above details would help me to understand your complaints better and therefore to make suggestions more specifically. However, at present, from your given history, I would suggest you as follows:1. As you already have chest/thorax scan as well as bronchoscopy which have not revealed any reason, I would think of possibility of asthma or upper respiratory cause like rhinitis, pharyngitis, sinusitis, etc. As you have sleep apnea, also it favors more of upper respiratory cause. However, detailed history is required before coming to a conclusion as well as to suggest tests.2. Once cause of your cough is found, appropriate medications can be suggested.3. In general, please avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.4. Regular warm saline gargles and steam inhalation can also help in a long run.5. Weight reduction would help increase your lung capacity as well as reduce sleep apnea. Hence, would improve both upper respiratory as well as lung symptoms. Please seek a professional advice for exercise and diet.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards.\n",

Hello.Welcome to HCM,In my opinion, it is due to some kind of psychological illness like upper respiratory infection, secondary to an allergic respiratory tract infection.The most common problem is the heart failure and it is due to systemic systemic infection of the respiratory tract.Management involves:1. A course of antibiotics to eradicate the causative organism.2. Asthalin & Seroflo inhaler- provide symptomatic relief by causing broncho-dilation (dilating the smaller airway passages, relieving the obstruction & increasing airflow to lungs). So, it is better to use inhalational bronchodilators (budesonide or fluticasone) when you have the symptoms.So, it can be used during an acute attack.So, use inhalational bronchodilators (budesonide or salmeterol) when you need to use a large quantity of antihistamine like salmeterol to eradicate the causative organism. So, you can avoid triggers of the diseases.So, the best option is to treat the symptoms by a physician (or doctor) who will examine the patients with clear guidance.Hope this helps you.If you have additional questions or follow up questions,please feel free to ask.Wish you good health.\n",

            "Coin shaped scars all over arms, itchy, swollen ears, lump over cartilage. What is it?I have been seeing a dermatologist for a few months now, and she's concluded that I have nummular eczema after 3 biopsies. I have coin shaped scars all over my arms--only my arms, I don't get them anywhere else. And now my ears are extremely itchy and swollen, and even a little lumpy all over the upper cartilage and it's extremely uncomfortable. I have a history of allergies but now I think it's strange my family members who don't have allergies are getting the same coins on their arms like I have. \n",
            "Hi,You must have sinusitis or upper respiratory infection.If you had both previously diagnosed with sinusitis or upper respiratory infection it's unlikely you would have both.A dermatologist can do both if there are no signs.Now, it's important to consider that infections can spread from one source to another.Hope this explains your concern.Wish you good health.Drink plenty of fluids and take care.\n",
            "Hi welcome to HCMDear Asthma is a very common respiratory disease, it affects the trachea and bronchial tubes by becoming inflamed and plugged with mucus. It can be triggered by allergies, air pollution, respiratory infections, emotions, weather conditions, This causes the airways to narrow, restricting the amount of air going to the lungs, and makes it very difficult to breathe.You are on  antibiotics and prednisone and inhaler. It is a matter of concern though, but should not worry, there are way to get rid of this problem.What you need to do is, to detoxify your system by modifying your life style and food habits and increase your immunity.1. Moderate exercise , walk, Yoga, Pranayam - Deep Breathing - slow to  fast, Bhraamarri, Tribandh , Kapaalbhati will strengthen your heart, chest and lungs, in fact whole body.2. Diet plays very important roll in maintaining your over all health. 3. Include all essential nutrients - fiber, vitamins, minerals and supplements full of antioxidants  and Use extra-virgin olive oil as your main fat.Increase intake of omega-3 fatty acids Vitamin B6 and Vitamin B12 are very important nutrients to treat asthma decreasing the inflammation in the lungs.Vitamin C Is needed to fight infection, increase the amount of oxygen and reduce inflammation. Lemon juice  and amla  are the  best source of vit C.Eat organically grown fruits and vegetables as much as possible. Take a level spoon of Turmeric Powder in a hot  goat's milk at bed time. It is contains natural antibiotics.Take crushed ginger, garlic with a little salt, a T spoon, before meals.Avoid protein to 10 percent of daily caloric intake. Replace animal protein as much as possible with plant proteinAvoid milk and milk products, substituting other calcium sources.Avoid processed foods carbs, sugar, fried,fast foods, Tea, coffee,alcohol and smoking, stress, sleeplessness and Constipation all will produce biochemical and metabolic conditions in your body that will decrease your immunity.So avoiding is definitely the first step in the right direction to detoxing the body, boosting the immune system.Always drink plenty of water to detoxify & keep your respiratory tract secretions more fluid.4.

            "HI, thanks for using healthcare magicBrief answer :Yes, you are right. As you mentioned fever is not associated with eye bleeding. It has to do with acute allergy or sinus infection. As you mentioned that you were coughing. So you were coughing and bleeding. It was almost down to the point where your eye could hardly open. And it went away when you sneezed. You may have some type of allergic reaction. Any irritation of the respiratory system will go away by itself. It is not hard to get yourself evaluated by a medical doctor. It will be better if you have a clear evaluation. In the mean time cough, fever, fever, and or bleeding may be due to acute allergy. If your eyes are clear, cough is not related to any infection. So if you are just cough then you should consider visiting your doctor to confirm the diagnosis. Hope this helps\n",

A course of antibiotics to eradicate the causative organism.2. Asthalin & Seroflo inhaler- provide symptomatic relief by causing broncho-dilation (dilating the smaller airway passages, relieving the obstruction & increasing airflow to lungs)Can be used during an acute attack.3. Montelukast preparations- used as a maintenance therapy to relieve symptoms of asthma.4. Antihistamine & anti tussive preparations for symptomatic relief from cough.5. Maintain adequate hydration & a healthy balance diet.6. Also make sure that you are well protected from cold, dust & other allergens.If symptoms still persist, kindly consult a Pulmonologist for proper clinical evaluation.Wishing a good health.Take care.\n",

I got in the swimming pool last night and it was an outdoor pool and kind of cool. this morning I woke up with fever, wheezing bad and my back in my lung area hurts so bad.

You may have strep throat infection with cough or a fever.    This may be due to systemic infection of the respiratory system. In addition to the above, you could have repeated infection of the lung lung tissue as your having cough and cough. You may have had pneumonia or a flu.
